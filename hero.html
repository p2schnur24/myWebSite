<p>Jackie Robinson was the first black male to join the MLB, he started out on the Brooklyn Dodger's B team, the Montreal Expos, he was not only challenged based off of his skill, but also how well he can handle racism. Not everyone wanted Jackie to stay in the MLB, even his teamates were throwing racial slurs towards him, but that did not stop him from being the best baseball player he could possibly be.

<p>I picked Jackie Robinson as my hero because he was able to overcome the fear of others being a racist towards him and his family, he was also able to make it through the MLB as the underdog, he had no experience in the big leagues before and he was able to win the national championship in 1955. He also inspired a lot of young black kids to follow their dreams, no matter what color, or race they are. </p>
